## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Breakout game using the Zig programming language. The goal is to break all the bricks using a ball while preventing the ball from falling off the screen using a paddle.

I was inspired by tsoding and his project [zigout](https://github.com/tsoding/zigout). So I'm sorry if my code have quite a resemblance of his. You can check out his [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIX9zER9vjY) as well.

Here is a picture of the game:
